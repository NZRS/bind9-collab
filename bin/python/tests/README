These are very simple preliminary tests for the dnssec-keymgr work;
they will be rolled into a "keymgr" system test later.

Poilcy test:

This is a basic test for the policy file reader; it compares
actual to expected results of loading a sample policy file.
To run the test:

$ python policy-test.py test.input > policy.out
$ diff policy.out policy.good 

Keymgr test:

This creates a series of keys scheduled for rollovers every six
months, then applies a policy to them to reschedule the rollovers
every 12 months.  Review the correctness of the outcome with
dnssec-coverage.

(This is going to need a lot more test cases.)
