Notes gathered during the IETF95 Hackathon, which can work as a TODO list

* PEP8. Ensure the code follows the recommendation of PEP8
* Add suport for CDS sync
* Add lots of test cases for key lifetime and simulated rollovers
    * Sanity check on policies: Coverage > Rollover period
    * Prepublish < rollover period
    * Postpublish < rollover period
* Generate new keys based on the policy used (of the right algorithm, with
the right lifetime)
* Documentation on how to use
* Add a verbose flag to print/supress debug messages

BUGS
* configure doesn't respect the proper python interpreter provided in the
command line, it tries to use the PATH
* Detection of the right python interpreter fails if the ply package is not
installed
* Test cases if they are multiple keys attempting to be activated at the same
 time.
