Notes gathered during the IETF95 Hackathon, which can work as a TODO list

* PEP8. Ensure the code follows the recommendation of PEP8
* Add suport for CDS sync
* Add lots of test cases for key lifetime and simulated rollovers
* Generate new keys based on the policy used (of the right algorithm, with
  the right lifetime) (DONE)
* Documentation on how to use

* "Verbose" flag (print dnssec-keygen and dnssec-settime commands as they
  are executed)
* Better error reporting when dnssec-keygen or dnssec-settime fail
* "Force" flag to allow keys to be updated even if their scheduled
  events are in the past
* Robustly handle the situation when events are in the past and the "force"
  flag isn't in use
* Add the ability to specify a key directory in policies, and use that
  in preference to '.' if set
* Use a default path to the policy.conf file, and only use the built-in
  default policy if it doesn't exist. (DONE)

BUGS
* configure doesn't respect the proper python interpreter provided in the
  command line, it tries to use the PATH
* Detection of the right python interpreter fails if the ply package is not
  installed
* Test cases if they are multiple keys attempting to be activated at the same
  time.
